Projects
---
**DFLpred:** a novel computational tool that predicts one of the major functions of disordered proteins, flexible linkers. It solves a binary classification problem that predicts if a given residue in an input sequence is a flexible linker or not.  
`Web server` [http://biomine-ws.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/](http://biomine-ws.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/)  
`Package` [https://fanchi.github.io/DFLpred/](https://fanchi.github.io/DFLpred/)  
`Back end` Java  
`Training model` Logistic regression  

**pcDETECT:** a web server that integrates two existing predictivemodels to predict if a given protein sequence can pass the four steps of the crystallization pipeline.  
`Web server` [http://biomine-ws.ece.ualberta.ca/pcDETECT/](http://biomine-ws.ece.ualberta.ca/pcDETECT/)  
`Back end` Java  
`Data analysis` Python
