## Projects
**DFLpred:** a novel computational tool that predicts one of the major functions of disordered proteins, flexible linkers. It solves a binary classification problem that predicts if a given residue in an input sequence is a flexible linker or not. I improved the prediction performance by 35% when compared with the second-best other method, measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), and improved the sensitivity by 1.3 times at the low range of false positive rates (<=0.1).

`Package` [https://fanchi.github.io/DFLpred/](https://fanchi.github.io/DFLpred/)  
`Back end` Java  
`Training model` Logistic regression  

**pcDETECT:** a web server that integrates two existing predictive models to predict if a given protein sequence can pass the four steps of the crystallization pipeline. It is the first web server that  allows users to run fast predictions for large dataset, and slower but more accurate predictions for small dataset. I also benchmarked the prediction performance of all other available tools.
